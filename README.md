## üè•Clinical Trial Patient Matching System

## Overview

This tool helps patients to find suitable clinical trials based on their medical and demographic profiles. The system utilizes AI/ML techniques, including TF-IDF and cosine similarity, to rank and recommend clinical trials with relevance scoring.

## Problem Statement: 

Build a tool that matches patients to relevant clinical trials based on eligibility criteria.

## Key Features

- **Patient Profile Input**: Collects age, gender, city, medical conditions, medications, allergies, and lab results.
  
- **Location-Aware Filtering**: Filters trials by Indian cities/states.
  
- **Disease-Specific Shortcuts**: Quick-tag options for common diseases.
  
- **Eligibility Matching**: Dynamically checks inclusion/exclusion criteria.
  
- **Semantic Matching**: Uses TF-IDF + cosine similarity to find relevant trials, accommodating varied terminology.
  
- **Weighted Scoring**: Trials are ranked based on rule-based and semantic relevance.
  
- **Results with Contact Info**: Displays trial details with a generic contact option (modal popup).

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
  
- **ML/NLP**: Scikit-learn (TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity)
  
- **Data**: JSON

## How to Use

- Fill out the patient‚Äôs form on the homepage.
  
- Select your location and relevant conditions/medications.
  
- Click **Find Matching Trials**.
  
- Review the trial cards, each showing a match score and eligibility info.
  
- Click **Contact Trial Coordinator** for general contact guidance.

## Future Improvements

- Implement BERT/NER for more accurate NLP parsing.
  
- Transition from `trials.json` to SQL.
  
- Add user login and patient profile saving.
  
- Introduce advanced trial filters (e.g., by trial phase).
  
- Create an admin panel for trial data upload.
  
- Integrate real contact options (if permissible).
  
- Develop a full testing suite and production-level logging.
